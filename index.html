    <p>Rattlesnakes are venomous snakes that are known as hunters. They are known for their <em>"rattle"</em> they make
        when in
        danger. </p>
    <p>They are really cool becuase despite being relatively smaller than most wild predators, they are some of the most
        deadly ones out there.
